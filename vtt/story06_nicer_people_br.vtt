Nicer people are poorer, says study.

00:05.500 --> 00:13.500
New research shows that nicer people are likely to be poorer than people who are not so nice.

00:13.500 --> 00:21.500
Researchers looked at how the personalities of different people affected how rich or well off they were.

00:21.500 --> 00:29.500
The researchers found that people with a nice, warm personality were worse off financially than people who were more selfish.

00:29.500 --> 00:37.500
Kinder people found it more difficult to look after their money.

00:37.500 --> 00:47.000
Researcher Dr. Joe Gladstone said this was because of the agreeableness of people who were kinder, more trusting and more caring.

00:47.000 --> 01:01.000
He said agreeableness is associated with financial hardship, including lower savings, higher debt and higher default rates.

01:01.000 --> 01:12.500
The researchers looked at data from different sources, including two online surveys.

01:12.500 --> 01:21.500
The surveys were taken by almost four thousand participants.

01:21.500 --> 01:33.000
The data included answers to questions about people's financial situation, debt and attitudes towards money.

01:33.000 --> 01:45.000
They compared this data with surveys in which almost five thousand people answered questions about their personality.

01:45.000 --> 01:54.500
The surveys also measured how agreeable people were.

01:54.500 --> 02:06.500
The researchers said agreeable people seemed to care less about money.

02:06.500 --> 02:15.500
Because of this, they did not manage their money wisely.

02:15.500 --> 02:26.500
Researcher Sandra Matz said that being kind and trusting had financial costs.

02:26.500 --> 02:39.000
She said she wanted to better understand why nice guys seem to finish last.
