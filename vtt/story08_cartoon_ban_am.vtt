Cartoon character ban could come to candy bars.

00:05.500 --> 00:14.000
Candy and chocolate manufacturers in the UK may have to stop using cartoon characters on their products.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.500
An alliance of health groups said many food companies use characters from Peppa Pig and Disney on their packaging.

00:23.500 --> 00:32.500
The companies use the characters to get children to buy chocolate and candies.

00:32.500 --> 00:42.000
The health groups said fifty-one percent of products using cartoon characters were unhealthy for children.

00:42.000 --> 00:52.000
The products fell below the health requirements needed to advertise on TV during children's shows.

00:52.000 --> 01:02.500
The health groups said the products were very high in fat, sugar and salt.

01:02.500 --> 01:13.500
The groups are asking the government to ban the use of these characters to sell unhealthy products to children.

01:13.500 --> 01:23.500
There are three groups trying to get a ban on cartoon characters on chocolate and candy.

01:23.500 --> 01:33.500
They are Action on Sugar, Action on Salt and the Children's Food Campaign.

01:33.500 --> 01:45.500
They looked at the nutrition content of five hundred and twenty-six products that were aimed at children.

01:45.500 --> 01:55.500
The products' wrapping had colorful cartoon characters to appeal to children.

01:55.500 --> 02:06.500
The Peppa Pig Candy Bites were among the worst products.

02:06.500 --> 02:14.500
These contained ninety-nine percent sugar.

02:14.500 --> 02:36.000
Dr. Kather Hashem said it is shocking that companies are exploiting the health of children by using cartoon characters on high-sugar food and drink products.
