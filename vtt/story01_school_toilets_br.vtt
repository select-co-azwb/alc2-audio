00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Head teacher has to clean school toilets

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.600
Times are hard for schools in England because they have so little money to spend.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
They have to cut back on many things.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There is austerity in the UK so the government has cut school budgets.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.000
One head teacher at a school in London does not have enough money to pay for cleaners or canteen staff.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.000
This means she has to help to clean the toilets and serve students in the school cafeteria.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Ms. Siobhan Lowe is head of Tolworth Girls' School in south London.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.000
She recently told reporters that she was embarrassed because her school did not have enough money to support her students.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Ms. Lowe said she has sold school land, cut subjects and fired her deputy-head teacher to keep her school open.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The south London school is typical of many schools in the UK.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Thousands of head teachers have to make difficult decisions about how to spend their school's money.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
More than 7,000 head teachers recently wrote to 3.5 million parents to explain why the schools have no money.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
Many parents have become volunteers at schools to help the children.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:33.000
Some schools have asked parents to provide toilet paper and other basics for the school toilets and classrooms.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
One school only has enough money to give students one sheet of A4 paper a month.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Head teachers want to meet the UK's education secretary, but he refused to meet them. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The UK's Department for Education said funding for education was a government priority.
