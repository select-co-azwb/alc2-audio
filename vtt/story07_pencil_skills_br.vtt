00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Children lack skill in holding pencils due to iPads

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:15.200
A study shows that new technology is reducing children's ability to use a pencil or pen.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.800
The study is from the National Health Service in the UK.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Researchers said that nowadays, children spend so much time swiping iPads or mobile phone screens that they cannot hold a pencil properly.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.000
Children are not using pencils, so they now lack the muscle strength in their hands to be able to write properly.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.600
Researcher Dr. Sally Payne said: "Children are not coming into school with the hand strength and [ability] they had 10 years ago.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.200
Children coming into school are being given a pencil but are increasingly not able to hold it because they don't have the fundamental movement skills."

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.800
The researchers said technology is changing the physical way that children write, draw or make things.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.400
Children are increasingly using technology to create.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.000
Dr. Payne explained why.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.600
She said: "It's easier to give a child an iPad than encourage them to do muscle-building play such as building blocks, cutting and sticking, or pulling toys and ropes.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.200
Because of this, they're not developing the underlying foundation skills they need to grip and hold a pencil."

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.800
Some experts say technology may be causing bigger problems.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.400
One expert said if a child isn't strong enough to hold a pencil, perhaps their whole body is weak.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.000
She said it was better for children's physical development to climb trees than to watch YouTube videos.
