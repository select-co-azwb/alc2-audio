Japanese women rebel against high heels.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
Women across Japan are fed up with having to wear high-heeled shoes to work.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
One woman is so fed up that she started a movement to end the requirement for female employees to wear the shoes.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
The movement has the hashtag KuToo.

00:23.000 --> 00:31.000
This is a combination of the Japanese words "kutsu" (which means shoe) and "kutsuu" (which is the Japanese word for pain).

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
The movement was started by Japanese actress Yumi Ishikawa.

00:36.500 --> 00:43.000
She tweeted about her belief that employers in Japan should not require female workers to wear high heels.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Ms. Ishikawa also launched an online petition.

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
It asks Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to forbid employers from requiring women to wear certain types of shoes.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Ishikawa's tweet is now spreading across other parts of Asia.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
Many women in China and South Korea have started their own campaigns against having to wear high heels.

01:08.500 --> 01:17.000
Ishikawa told TIME magazine: "I thought that if there are so many people who feel the same as me, why not start some sort of movement."

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Many women supported Ishikawa on social media.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
They complained about sore feet, bleeding heels, back pain and other health issues.

01:29.000 --> 01:37.000
A visually impaired woman in her 20s who has to wear high heels at work said it is difficult for her to keep her balance and not fall over.

01:38.000 --> 01:47.000
A recent survey found that over 70 percent of women working in Tokyo wear high heels to work at least once a week.
