Japanese women rebel against high heels.

00:05.500 --> 00:12.500
Women across Japan are fed up with having to wear high-heeled shoes to work.

00:12.500 --> 00:21.500
One woman is so fed up that she started a movement to end the requirement for female employees to wear the shoes.

00:21.500 --> 00:27.000
The movement has the hashtag KuToo.

00:27.000 --> 00:37.500
This is a combination of the Japanese words "kutsu", which means shoe, and "kutsuu", which means pain.

00:37.500 --> 00:44.500
The movement was started by Japanese actress Yumi Ishikawa.

00:44.500 --> 00:55.000
She tweeted about her belief that employers in Japan should not require female workers to wear high heels.

00:55.000 --> 01:03.500
Ms. Ishikawa also launched an online petition.

01:03.500 --> 01:14.500
It asks Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to forbid employers from requiring women to wear certain types of shoes.

01:14.500 --> 01:23.500
Ishikawa's tweet is now spreading across other parts of Asia.

01:23.500 --> 01:34.500
Many women in China and South Korea have started their own campaigns against having to wear high heels.

01:34.500 --> 01:49.000
Ishikawa told TIME magazine that if so many people feel the same as her, she thought it was time to start a movement.

01:49.000 --> 02:00.000
Many women supported Ishikawa on social media.

02:00.000 --> 02:13.000
They complained about sore feet, bleeding heels, back pain and other health issues.

02:13.000 --> 02:28.000
A visually impaired woman in her 20s said wearing high heels at work makes it difficult for her to keep her balance.

02:28.000 --> 02:37.000
She said it is hard for her not to fall over.

02:37.000 --> 02:51.000
A recent survey found that over 70 percent of women working in Tokyo wear high heels to work at least once a week.
