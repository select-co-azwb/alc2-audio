Egypt opens ancient pyramids for first time since 1960’s

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.260
Egypt has opened two of its oldest pyramids.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.890
The pyramids are in Dahshur, about 40 kilometers south of the Egyptian capital city Cairo.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.520
They are now open to the public for the first time since 1965.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.150
Hundreds of people gathered outside the Bent Pyramid at a special opening ceremony on Saturday.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.780
The Bent Pyramid was built 4,600 years ago.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.410
It was built for the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Sneferu.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.040
It is 101 meters high.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.670
Builders used new techniques to build it and archaeologists say it was an important step in the development of pyramid building.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.300
Tourists can also enter an 18-metre high "side pyramid" next to the Bent Pyramid.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.930
This was built for King Sneferu's wife Hetepheres.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.560
The two pyramids are part of the Memphis Necropolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.190
Egypt hopes the opening of the pyramids will boost the country's tourism industry.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.820
Egypt was a top tourist destination but tourist numbers fell after the 2011 uprising.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.450
Ancient sites in Egypt are on the bucket lists of many people around the world.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.080
At the Bent Pyramid, tourists will be able to go through a 79-meter narrow tunnel to reach two chambers deep inside.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.710
They will also be able to see ancient treasures found inside the pyramid.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:17.340
Egyptian archaeologists uncovered a collection of stone, clay and wooden sarcophagi - the coffins people were buried in.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.000
Some of the sarcophagi contained mummies.
