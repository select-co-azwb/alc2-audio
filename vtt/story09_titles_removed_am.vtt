University ends use of Mr., Ms. and Mrs.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A university in South Africa has decided to no longer use titles such as Mr., Ms. or Mrs.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The University of the Witwatersrand said it will stop using these titles on any form of communication with students.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It took this decision to support people who were transgender or gender non-conforming.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A statement from officials read: "The university realizes that it is invalidating and distressing for a person who‚ for example‚ was… female at birth but identifies as male to be constantly addressed by a non-affirming title."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It added that people who were transgender or non-binary are choosing the gender-neutral title "Mx.," which is legally recognized in many countries across the world.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The decision has been widely welcomed by the university community.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The university said it, "opposes all public and private discrimination on the basis of gender identity and gender expression".

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A university official said: "We want people in our university community to feel safe‚ supported and ultimately respected.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
As a transgender person myself‚ it means a lot being in a space which is welcoming."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
A law professor said the action was, "the most wonderful moment for true equality across a multitude of spectrums".

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
She added: "It's a triumph for an understanding of the diversity of gender identity‚ sexual orientation and the right to be respected for whomever you are."
