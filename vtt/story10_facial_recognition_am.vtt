San Francisco bans facial recognition software.

00:05.500 --> 00:14.500
San Francisco has become the first city in the USA to ban facial recognition software.

00:14.500 --> 00:23.500
The city has said police and other public departments cannot use the software.

00:23.500 --> 00:33.000
San Francisco already uses surveillance cameras for reading car number plates.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.500
Police officers in the city also wear body cameras.

00:41.500 --> 00:49.500
There is facial recognition technology at airports.

00:49.500 --> 01:01.000
Many officials wanted to introduce facial recognition in the city to increase security.

01:01.000 --> 01:13.500
They said the technology would make it cheaper and faster for police to find crime suspects.

01:13.500 --> 01:23.000
They also said it would help identify missing people.

01:23.000 --> 01:36.000
An expert on information technology said a ban would freeze San Francisco in time with outdated technology.

01:36.000 --> 01:47.000
There are many opponents of facial recognition technology.

01:47.000 --> 01:58.500
The technology is already being widely used in other parts of the world.

01:58.500 --> 02:10.500
San Francisco official Aaron Peskin called facial recognition a Big Brother technology.

02:10.500 --> 02:21.500
Big Brother is a character in the book Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell.

02:21.500 --> 02:34.000
The phrase Big Brother is used to describe attempts by governments to increase surveillance.

02:34.000 --> 02:45.500
It is also used to describe efforts to spy on citizens.

02:45.500 --> 02:58.500
Mr. Peskin said it is possible to have security without being a security state.

02:58.500 --> 03:10.500
He said good policing does not require becoming a police state.

03:10.500 --> 03:28.000
He added that trust should be built with the community, not through Big Brother technology.
