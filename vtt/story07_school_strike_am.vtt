00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
School children go on strike for climate.

00:05.500 --> 00:13.500
School children around the world have been going on strike.

00:13.500 --> 00:22.000
They are unhappy that their governments are doing too little to fight climate change.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
The strikes are part of a growing international movement called School Strike for Climate.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Instead of going to school, students across the globe have been skipping classes to take part in street protests.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.500
Many of the protests have been outside government buildings.

00:48.500 --> 00:58.000
The movement began in August 2018.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
Swedish student Greta Thunberg stood outside Sweden's government every Friday.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
She held a sign that read, "School strike for climate".

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
Photos of her went viral on social media.

01:25.000 --> 01:34.000
Students organized themselves and copied Ms. Thunberg's actions.

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
The movement is growing worldwide.

01:44.000 --> 01:55.000
In 2019, strikes have taken place across Europe, North America and Australia.

01:55.000 --> 02:05.000
Over forty-five thousand students protested on one day in Switzerland and Germany.

02:05.000 --> 02:18.000
Students have held banners reading, "Why learn without a future?"

02:18.000 --> 02:30.000
Other banners read, "If you do not act as adults, we will".

02:30.000 --> 02:41.000
Some banners read, "Like the sea level, we rise".

02:41.000 --> 02:51.000
The first worldwide strike will take place on March fifteenth.

02:51.000 --> 03:02.000
Many scientists, politicians and teachers congratulated the students for their activism.

03:02.000 --> 03:13.000
However, not everyone is on the students' side.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
Australia's leader called for more learning in schools and less activism.

03:23.000 --> 03:37.000
A journalist in the U.K. criticized the students and said protests should take place at the weekend.
