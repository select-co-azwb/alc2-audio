Restaurant bans customer for eating too much.

00:06.512 --> 00:12.416
A sushi restaurant in Germany has banned a customer for eating too much food.

00:12.416 --> 00:17.969
The customer was an ironman athlete called Jaroslav Bobrowski.

00:17.969 --> 00:23.869
He visited the Running Sushi restaurant in Bavaria last weekend.

00:23.869 --> 00:30.463
He paid 15.90 euros, about eighteen dollars and forty-nine cents, for an all-you-can-eat buffet meal.

00:30.463 --> 00:36.370
Mr. Bobrowski then sat down and ate nearly a hundred plates of sushi.

00:36.000 --> 00:47.000
When he went to pay for his meal, the owner told him that he could no longer return to the restaurant, because of how much he ate.

00:45.674 --> 00:50.534
He told a local newspaper, “I’m banned from now on because I ate too much.”

00:50.534 --> 00:54.699
He said the decision of the owner left him feeling stunned.

00:54.699 --> 01:01.293
He told reporters that he was a regular customer at the restaurant.

01:01.293 --> 01:07.540
Mr. Bobrowski said he ate so much because of his ironman diet.

01:04.940 --> 01:11.188
He follows a diet where he does not eat for twenty hours and then eats until he is full.

01:11.188 --> 01:17.088
He had no problems eating at the restaurant on previous visits.

01:13.688 --> 01:20.283
But the last time, the manager decided the amount he ate was not good for business.

01:21.883 --> 01:26.743
The owner told a German news agency, “He eats for five people. That's not normal.”

01:26.743 --> 01:32.644
A newspaper said the restaurant waiter did not accept a tip from Bobrowski when he went to pay.

01:32.644 --> 01:39.239
Bobrowski said, “When I went to the checkout, I wanted to leave a tip, but the waiter did not want to accept it.”

01:39.239 --> 01:44.800
He now needs to find another restaurant that provides delicious and good value meals.
