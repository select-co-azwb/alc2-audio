00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Train drivers in the UK earn more than pilots.

00:05.500 --> 00:14.500
Newspapers in England are reporting that subway train drivers get paid more than pilots, doctors, police officers and nurses.

00:14.500 --> 00:25.000
The Sunday Times newspaper reports that the three highest-paid drivers on the London Underground earned one hundred and thirty thousand dollars last year.

00:25.000 --> 00:36.000
This included overtime, bonuses and pension payments.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.500
It is a sixty-nine percent rise in pay since twenty twelve.

00:45.500 --> 00:55.500
Journalists say the basic salary of a train driver is seventy thousand dollars a year.

00:55.500 --> 01:07.000
This is double the average wage of a nurse in London and more than what many airline pilots earn.

01:07.000 --> 01:17.500
The newspaper reports that police officers in London have a starting salary of twenty-eight thousand dollars.

01:17.500 --> 01:28.500
In addition to their pay, London Underground train drivers get over eight weeks of paid holiday a year.

01:28.500 --> 01:39.500
Many people think the high salaries train drivers get are unfair.

01:39.500 --> 01:52.000
James Roberts of the Tax-Payers' Alliance said these salaries are totally wrong.

01:52.000 --> 02:04.500
He said that the role of a subway train driver is getting easier.

02:04.500 --> 02:16.500
He said many train drivers no longer have to drive the trains because many lines are fully automated.

02:16.500 --> 02:26.500
He said drivers on automated train lines only have to open and close train doors.

02:26.500 --> 02:38.500
He was also surprised the drivers were going on strike for more pay.

02:38.500 --> 03:05.000
A train drivers' spokesman said their pay was for the professionalism and expertise of delivering a public service for hundreds of thousands of passengers every day.
