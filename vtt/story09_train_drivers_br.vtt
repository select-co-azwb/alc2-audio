Train drivers in UK earn more than pilots

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Newspapers in England are reporting that subway train drivers get paid more than pilots, doctors, police officers and nurses.

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
The Sunday Times newspaper reports that the three highest-paid drivers on the London Underground earned $130,000 last year.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.000
This included overtime, bonuses and pension payments.

00:31.500 --> 00:36.000
It is a 69 per cent rise in pay since 2012.

00:36.500 --> 00:42.000
Journalists say the basic salary of a train driver is $70,000 a year.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
This is double the average wage of a nurse in London and more than what many airline pilots earn.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
The newspaper reports that police officers in London have a starting salary of $28,000.

00:57.500 --> 01:04.000
In addition to their pay, London Underground train drivers get over eight weeks paid holiday a year.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Many people think the high salaries train drivers get are unfair.

01:09.500 --> 01:20.000
James Roberts of the Tax-Payers' Alliance said: "These salaries are totally wrong....Increasingly, the role of a subway train driver is getting easier."

01:21.000 --> 01:28.000
He said that many train drivers no longer have to drive the trains because many train lines are fully automated.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
He said drivers on automated train lines only have to open and close train doors.

01:36.500 --> 01:41.000
He was also surprised the drivers were going on strike for more pay.

01:42.000 --> 01:57.000
A train drivers' spokesman said their pay was for, "the professionalism, and expertise...of delivering a professional public service for hundreds of thousands of passengers traveling on the Underground...every day."
