Bangkok street-food chef says no to international cooking honor

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A street-food seller in Bangkok wants to give back a top international chef's award.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The street-food seller is known as the "crab omelet queen".

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Her name is Supinya Junsuta but she calls herself Jai Fai.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Her street stall is in the middle of Bangkok and it is called Raan Jai Fai.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Her crab omelets are of such good quality that the international dining guide Michelin awarded her a Michelin Star.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
A Michelin Star is one of the highest awards any chef in the world can receive.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It is usually only given to chefs in top hotels and restaurants.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Michelin announced it would be adding Bangkok to its fine dining lists.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Many people were surprised that a street-food seller in Bangkok received the Michelin Star.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Chefs are usually happy to get the Michelin Star, but Jai Fai, 72, has told reporters she is not so pleased that she got the award.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
She wants to return the star to Michelin.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Ms. Fai said the star has changed her life too much.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
She wants to go back to how her life was before.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
She said she does not like the fame that has come with the star.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
One reason is that too many people are surrounding her stall and she is getting stressed.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Tourists come to take photos; passers-by stop to watch her; and even some officials from the tax department came to visit her.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Fai said: "Many people come just to look and take pictures and not necessarily to eat."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
She said happy customers are more important to her than "a million stars".
