Canadian doctors using art to treat patients

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in Canada has teamed up with a group of doctors to help sick people.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The doctors will prescribe visits to Montreal's art galleries, instead of giving them medicine.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The museum is currently taking part in 10 trials on patients to find out what effect art has on health.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The patients include people with breast cancer, eating disorders, epilepsy and mental health problems.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Thomas Bastien, director of education and wellness at the museum, believes that art heals.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
He said: "We saw that the museum was good for people, so we decided to start this program with the doctors.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you're suffering from breast cancer, you could come to the museum and you might feel better."

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A doctor who has a lot of experience in helping to heal people with art spoke about the benefits of art therapy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Dr Hélène Boyer said: "There's more and more scientific proof that art therapy is good for your physical health."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
She said looking at art increases hormones released in our bodies.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.000
These hormones are responsible for our well-being.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Dr Boyer said visiting art galleries released the same kinds of hormones that are released when we exercise.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Nathalie Bondil, the museum's director-general, said physical activity and art gave similar health benefits.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
She said: "I am convinced that in the 21st century, [art] will be what physical activity was for health in the 20th century."
