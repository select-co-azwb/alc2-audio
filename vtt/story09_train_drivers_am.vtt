Train drivers in UK earn more than pilots

00:07.000 --> 00:17.000
Newspapers in England are reporting that subway train drivers get paid more than pilots, doctors, police officers and nurses.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
The Sunday Times newspaper reports that the three highest-paid drivers on the London Underground earned $130,000 last year.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
This included overtime, bonuses and pension payments.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
It is a 69 per cent rise in pay since 2012.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
Journalists say the basic salary of a train driver is $70,000 a year.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
This is double the average wage of a nurse in London and more than what many airline pilots earn.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
The newspaper reports that police officers in London have a starting salary of $28,000.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
In addition to their pay, London Underground train drivers get over eight weeks paid holiday a year.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Many people think the high salaries train drivers get are unfair.

01:13.000 --> 01:23.000
James Roberts of the Tax-Payers' Alliance said: "These salaries are totally wrong....Increasingly, the role of a subway train driver is getting easier."

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
He said that many train drivers no longer have to drive the trains because many train lines are fully automated.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
He said drivers on automated train lines only have to open and close train doors.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
He was also surprised the drivers were going on strike for more pay.

01:45.000 --> 02:04.000
A train drivers' spokesman said their pay was for, "the professionalism, and expertise...of delivering a professional public service for hundreds of thousands of passengers traveling on the Underground...every day."
