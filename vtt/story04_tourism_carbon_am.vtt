00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Carbon footprint of global tourism is huge.

00:05.500 --> 00:13.800
Climate scientists from the University of Sydney in Australia say tourism causes over 8 percent of greenhouse gasses.

00:13.800 --> 00:21.800
They also say that this figure will continue to increase because the tourism industry is growing.

00:21.800 --> 00:30.500
Their study looked at the carbon footprint of many different areas of tourism.

00:30.500 --> 00:40.500
It studied the CO2 emissions from transport, events, hotels, restaurants and shopping.

00:40.500 --> 00:47.500
It even researched the carbon emissions from producing souvenirs.

00:47.500 --> 00:54.800
The researchers spent 18 months conducting the research.

00:54.800 --> 01:02.800
They included the tourist activities of 189 countries.

01:02.800 --> 01:13.800
Researcher Dr. Arunima Malik said her team analyzed the impact on the environment of over one million businesses involved in tourism.

01:13.800 --> 01:22.500
The researchers said domestic travel was a bigger cause of CO2 emissions than international or business travel.

01:22.500 --> 01:28.800
Air travel was the largest part of tourism's footprint.

01:28.800 --> 01:39.000
The researchers said flying would continue to increase global emissions as more people in the world become richer.

01:39.000 --> 01:48.500
The countries causing the most harm were the biggest and richest nations.

01:48.500 --> 01:55.500
The USA, China, India and Germany had the largest tourism carbon footprints.

01:55.500 --> 02:04.500
Their carbon emissions will continue to increase as more of their citizens travel.

02:04.500 --> 02:18.500
The researchers encouraged holiday-makers and travelers to try and reduce their carbon footprint when on vacation so their travel causes less harm to the planet.
