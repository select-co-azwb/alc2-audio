Amazon Alexa to answer questions on health

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:17.380
Technology has taken another step in helping us with our healthcare.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:26.070
We can now ask the digital device Alexa for advice if we are worried about our health.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.760
Alexa is a virtual assistant created by the website Amazon.com.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.450
It is capable of listening to people and answering their questions.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:52.140
As well as voice interaction capabilities, Alexa can make to-do lists, play music upon voice request, and give us the latest news.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.830
Now Alexa can answer our health queries.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:09.520
Amazon has linked up with the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK to add a health advice capability to the software.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:18.210
Alexa will be able to search the NHS website for information and find an answer that is agreed on by many health experts.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.900
Alexa's new health advice capability has been met with a mixed response.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:35.590
The UK Health Secretary said: "Technology like this is a great example of how people can access reliable, world-leading advice from the comfort of their home, reducing the pressure on our hardworking doctors and pharmacists."

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.280
He added: "We want to empower every patient to take better control of their healthcare."

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:53.000
Other people say we need to be careful about trusting the advice of a piece of software. They say we must go to a human doctor if we have serious health problems. Other people are concerned about privacy. The group Big Brother Watch is worried about hacking. It said: "It's a data protection disaster waiting to happen."
