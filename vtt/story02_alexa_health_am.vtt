Amazon Alexa to answer questions on health

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Technology has taken another step in helping us with our healthcare.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.000
We can now ask the digital device Alexa for advice if we are worried about our health.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Alexa is a virtual assistant created by the website Amazon.com.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It is capable of listening to people and answering their questions.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
As well as voice interaction capabilities, Alexa can make to-do lists, play music upon voice request, and give us the latest news.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now Alexa can answer our health queries.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Amazon has linked up with the National Health Service or NHS in the UK to add a health advice capability to the software.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Alexa will be able to search the NHS website for information and find an answer that is agreed on by many health experts.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Alexa's new health advice capability has been met with a mixed response.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The UK Health Secretary said: "Technology like this is a great example of how people can access reliable, world-leading advice from the comfort of their home, reducing the pressure on our hardworking doctors and pharmacists."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He added: "We want to empower every patient to take better control of their healthcare."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Other people say we need to be careful about trusting the advice of a piece of software. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.000
They say we must go to a human doctor if we have serious health problems. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Other people are concerned about privacy. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The group Big Brother Watch is worried about hacking. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:53.000
It said: "It's a data protection disaster waiting to happen."
