San Francisco bans facial recognition software

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
San Francisco has become the first city in the USA to ban facial recognition software.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
The city has said police and other public departments cannot use the software.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
San Francisco already uses surveillance cameras for reading car number plates and police officers wear body cameras.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.000
There is facial recognition at airports.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Many officials wanted to introduce facial recognition in the city to increase security.

00:39.500 --> 00:50.000
They said facial recognition technology would make it cheaper and faster for police to find crime suspects and identify missing people.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.000
An expert on information technology said: 

00:53.500 --> 01:01.000
"A ban on facial recognition will make San Francisco frozen in time with outdated technology."

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
There are many opponents of the technology, which is being widely used in other parts of the world.

01:09.000 --> 01:16.000
San Francisco official Aaron Peskin called facial recognition a "Big Brother" technology.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Big Brother is a character in the book "Nineteen Eighty-Four" by George Orwell.

01:22.000 --> 01:32.000
The phrase Big Brother is now used to describe attempts by governments or authorities to increase surveillance and "spy" on citizens.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
Mr. Peskin said: "We can have security without being a security state." 

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
"We can have good policing without being a police state."

01:44.000 --> 01:54.000
He added that: "Part of that is building trust with the community based on good community information, not on Big Brother technology."
