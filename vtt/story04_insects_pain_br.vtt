Insects really feel pain, says new research

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
New research shows that insects feel pain.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The researchers say it isn't the same kind of pain that humans feel.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The pain that insects feel is a sensation that is like pain.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The research was conducted at the University of Sydney in Australia.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Professor Greg Neely, co-author of the research report, said: "People don't really think of insects as feeling any kind of pain, but it's already been shown in lots of different invertebrate animals that they can sense and avoid dangerous [things] that we [think of] as painful."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
He added: "We knew that insects could sense 'pain' but what we didn't know is that an injury could lead to long-lasting hyper-sensitivity… in a similar way to human patients' experiences."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The researchers looked at how fruit flies reacted to injuries.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The scientists damaged one leg on the flies and allowed the leg to heal.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They found that after the leg fully healed, the flies became more sensitive and tried harder to protect their legs.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Professor Neely said the pain the flies felt stayed in their memory and this changed their behavior.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He said: "After the [insect] is hurt once badly, they are hypersensitive and try to protect themselves for the rest of their lives."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Neely says he hopes to carry out more research to better understand how humans feel pain.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He said: "We are focused on making new stem cell therapies or drugs that target the underlying cause and stop pain for good."
