She posted a video to her Instagram page advertising small jars of her old bath water for $30.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.440
She added: "This water is not for drinking and should only be used for sentimental purposes."

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.620
She then winks at the camera and lets water from her mouth drip into a small bottle.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.800

She has gained a lot of popularity on social media by sitting in a bath filled with water in skimpy clothes.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.700

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.240

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.600
