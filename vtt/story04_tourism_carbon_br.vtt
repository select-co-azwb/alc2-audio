00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Carbon footprint of global tourism is huge.

00:07.000 --> 00:15.000
Climate scientists from the University of Sydney in Australia say tourism causes over 8 percent of greenhouse gasses.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
They also say that this figure will continue to increase because the tourism industry is growing.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Their study looked at the carbon footprint of many different areas of tourism.

00:28.000 --> 00:35.000
It studied the CO2 emissions from transport, events, hotels, restaurants and shopping.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
It even researched the carbon emissions from producing souvenirs.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
The researchers spent 18 months conducting the research.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
They included the tourist activities of 189 countries.

00:51.000 --> 01:02.000
Researcher Dr. Arunima Malik said her team analyzed the impact on the environment of over one million businesses involved in tourism.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
The researchers said domestic travel was a bigger cause of CO2 emissions than international or business travel.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Air travel was the largest part of tourism's footprint.

01:17.000 --> 01:25.000
The researchers said flying would continue to increase global emissions as more people in the world become richer.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
The countries causing the most harm were the biggest and richest nations.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
The USA, China, India and Germany had the largest tourism carbon footprints.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
Their carbon emissions will continue to increase as more of their citizens travel.

01:43.000 --> 01:57.000
The researchers encouraged holiday-makers and travelers to try and reduce their carbon footprint when on vacation so their travel causes less harm to the planet.
