Restaurant bans customer for eating too much.

00:06.512 --> 00:12.416
A sushi restaurant in Germany has banned a customer for eating too much food.

00:12.416 --> 00:17.969
The customer was an ironman athlete called Jaroslav Bobrowski.

00:17.169 --> 00:23.069
He visited the Running Sushi restaurant in Bavaria last weekend.

00:20.069 --> 00:26.663
He paid 15.9 euros, about eighteen point four nine dollars, for an all-you-can-eat buffet meal.

00:31.063 --> 00:36.970
Mr. Bobrowski then sat down and ate nearly a hundred plates of sushi.

00:36.600 --> 00:47.600
When he went to pay for his meal, the owner told him that he could no longer return to the restaurant, because of how much he ate.

00:45.274 --> 00:50.134
He told a local newspaper, “I’m banned from now on because I ate too much.”

00:51.134 --> 00:55.299
He said the decision of the owner left him feeling stunned.

00:55.299 --> 01:01.893
He told reporters that he was a regular customer at the restaurant.

01:01.893 --> 01:08.140
Mr. Bobrowski said he ate so much because of his ironman diet.

01:05.540 --> 01:11.788
He follows a diet where he does not eat for twenty hours and then eats until he is full.

01:13.188 --> 01:19.088
He had no problems eating at the restaurant on previous visits.

01:15.688 --> 01:22.283
But the last time, the manager decided the amount he ate was not good for business.

01:23.883 --> 01:28.743
The owner told a German news agency that, “He eats for five people. That is not normal.”

01:33.243 --> 01:39.144
A newspaper said the restaurant waiter did not accept a tip from Bobrowski when he went to pay.

01:41.144 --> 01:47.739
Bobrowski said, “When I went to the checkout, I wanted to leave a tip, but the waiter did not want to accept it.”

01:49.539 --> 01:55.100
He now needs to find another restaurant that provides delicious and good value meals.
