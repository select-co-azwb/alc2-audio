00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Going to bed early is better for us

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
The phrase, "The early bird catches the worm" may be true.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
It means people who wake up early get more done than people who don't.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Another saying is from former U.S. President Benjamin Franklin.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
He said: "Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise."

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
Scientists have found that people who go to bed before 11pm may do better in life than people who sleep around 2:30am.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
The researchers are from Birmingham's Centre for Human Brain Health in the U.K.

00:45.000 --> 00:56.000
Their research showed that people who slept and rose early (early birds) had an advantage over people who slept and woke up late (night owls).

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
There were differences in the brain function of early birds and night owls.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
The scientists tested 38 people in their research.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
The people answered questionnaires about their sleeping pattern and when they felt tired during the day.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
They were then put into an early bird or night owl group based on their answers.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
All of the people had MRI scans on their brain and did different tests throughout the day.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
The early birds said they felt less sleepy and were able to do the tests quicker than the night owls.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
The researchers said there were big differences between the two groups.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
The researchers said: "Night owls during school have to get up earlier, 

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
then they go into work and they have to get up earlier, 

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
so they're constantly having to fight against their preferences and natural rhythms."
