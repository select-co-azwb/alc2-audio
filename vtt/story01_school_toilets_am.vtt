00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Head teacher has to clean school toilets

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Times are hard for schools in England because they have so little money to spend.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They have to cut back on many things.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There is austerity in the UK so the government has cut school budgets.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.000
One head teacher at a school in London does not have enough money to pay for cleaners or canteen staff.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.000
This means she has to help clean the toilets and serve students in the school cafeteria.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Ms. Siobhan Lowe is head of Tolworth Girls' School in south London.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
She recently told reporters that she was embarrassed because her school did not have enough money to support her students.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Ms. Lowe said she has sold school land, cut subjects and fired her deputy-head teacher to keep her school open.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The south London school is typical of many schools in the UK.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Thousands of head teachers have to make difficult decisions about how to spend their school's money.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
More than 7,000 head teachers recently wrote to 3.5 million parents to explain why the schools have no money.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Many parents have become volunteers at schools to help the children.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Some schools have asked parents to provide toilet paper and other basics for the school toilets and classrooms.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
One school only has enough money to give students one sheet of A4 paper a month.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Head teachers want to meet the UK's education secretary, but he refused to meet them.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The UK's Department for Education said funding for education was a government priority.
