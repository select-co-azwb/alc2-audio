Bangkok street-food chef says no to international cooking honor

00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:12.736
A street-food seller in Bangkok wants to give back a top international chef's award.

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:19.104
The street-food seller is known as the "crab omelet queen".

00:00:19.104 --> 00:00:25.472
Her name is Supinya Junsuta but she calls herself Jai Fai.

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:31.840
Her street stall is in the middle of Bangkok and it is called Raan Jai Fai.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.208
Her crab omelets are of such good quality that the international dining guide Michelin awarded her a Michelin Star.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:44.576
A Michelin Star is one of the highest awards any chef in the world can receive.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:50.944
It is usually only given to chefs in top hotels and restaurants.

00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:57.312
Michelin announced it would be adding Bangkok to its fine dining lists.

00:00:57.312 --> 00:01:03.680
Many people were surprised that a street-food seller in Bangkok received the Michelin Star.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.048
Chefs are usually happy to get the Michelin Star, but Jai Fai, 72, has told reporters she is not so pleased that she got the award.

00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:16.416
She wants to return the star to Michelin.

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:22.784
Ms. Fai said the star has changed her life too much.

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:29.152
She wants to go back to how her life was before.

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:35.520
She said she does not like the fame that has come with the star.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.888
One reason is that too many people are surrounding her stall and she is getting stressed.

00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:48.256
Tourists come to take photos; passers-by stop to watch her; and even some officials from the tax department came to visit her.

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:54.624
Fai said: "Many people come just to look and take pictures and not necessarily to eat."

00:01:54.624 --> 00:02:01.000
She said happy customers are more important to her than "a million stars".
