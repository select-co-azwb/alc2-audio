Japanese city asks tourists to stop ‘sand graffiti’

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A city in Japan is having a problem with graffiti.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
However, it is not the usual type of graffiti with paint from spray cans being used to write on walls.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It is graffiti in sand.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Officials in the city of Tottori are asking tourists to refrain from writing messages and pictures in the sand of its giant sand dunes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The officials said the graffiti causes damage to the dunes and destroys the pleasure others get in looking at the sand.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They said that more than 3,300 cases of 'sand graffiti' have occurred at the tourist hotspot in the last decade.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The Mainichi newspaper said there were more than 200 cases reported last year.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In January, two overseas tourists were ordered to erase a 25-metre-long message that read: 'Happy Birthday Natalie'.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The Tottori Sand Dunes are famous throughout Japan for their natural beauty.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
They are the largest and longest sand dunes in the country and form part of a scenic geo-coastal park on the Sea of Japan coast.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The biggest dune is 50 meters high.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The dunes stretch for 16 kilometers along the coast.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The local government wants to improve tourists' understanding of the importance of the dunes.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It will set up more signs in English, Chinese and Korean asking people to respect the dunes.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
A spokesman said: "We are concerned about whether the rules are fully understood, but we want to continue to protect views of the beautiful sand dunes."
