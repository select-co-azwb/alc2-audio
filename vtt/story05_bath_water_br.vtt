It is so popular that the water has sold out.

She has over four million followers across the social media site.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
She posted a video to her Instagram page advertising small jars of her old bath water for $30.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In the video, she said: "Gamer boys - It's time to get your gamer girl bath water."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
She added: "This water is not for drinking and should only be used for sentimental purposes."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
She then winks at the camera and lets water from her mouth drip into a small bottle.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Thousands of her fans eagerly placed an order for the water.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
She has gained a lot of popularity on social media by sitting in a bath filled with water in skimpy clothes.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
She also calls herself Gamer Girl.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Selling her old bath water is her latest idea to make money from her followers.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Followers can pay up to $2,500 for some of the selfies.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Belle said she is constantly trying to "come up with weird ideas" to make money.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Her bath water idea has not been popular with everyone on social media.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
