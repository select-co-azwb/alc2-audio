Japanese city asks tourists to stop ‘sand graffiti’

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:13.250
A city in Japan is having a problem with graffiti.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.875
However, it is not the usual type of graffiti with paint from spray cans being used to write on walls.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:26.500
It is graffiti in sand.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.125
Officials in the city of Tottori are asking tourists to refrain from writing messages and pictures in the sand of its giant sand dunes.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:39.750
The officials said the graffiti causes damage to the dunes and destroys the pleasure others get in looking at the sand.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.375
They said that more than 3,300 cases of 'sand graffiti' have occurred at the tourist hotspot in the last decade.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:53.000
The Mainichi newspaper said there were more than 200 cases reported last year.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.625
In January, two overseas tourists were ordered to erase a 25-metre-long message that read: 'Happy Birthday Natalie'.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:06.250
The Tottori Sand Dunes are famous throughout Japan for their natural beauty.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.875
They are the largest and longest sand dunes in the country and form part of a scenic geo-coastal park on the Sea of Japan coast.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:19.500
The biggest dune is 50 meters high.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.125
The dunes stretch for 16 kilometers along the coast.

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:32.750
The local government wants to improve tourists' understanding of the importance of the dunes.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.375
It will set up more signs in English, Chinese and Korean asking people to respect the dunes.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:46.000
A spokesman said: "We are concerned about whether the rules are fully understood, but we want to continue to protect views of the beautiful sand dunes."
