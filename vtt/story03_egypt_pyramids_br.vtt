Egypt opens ancient pyramids for first time since 1960’s

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Egypt has opened two of its oldest pyramids.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The pyramids are in Dahshur, about 40 kilometers south of the Egyptian capital city Cairo.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
They are now open to the public for the first time since 1965.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Hundreds of people gathered outside the Bent Pyramid at a special opening ceremony on Saturday.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The Bent Pyramid was built 4,600 years ago.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.940
It was built for the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Sneferu.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.000
It is 101 meters high.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Builders used new techniques to build it and archaeologists say it was an important step in the development of pyramid building.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Tourists can also enter an 18-metre high "side pyramid" next to the Bent Pyramid.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This was built for King Sneferu's wife Hetepheres.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The two pyramids are part of the Memphis Necropolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Egypt hopes the opening of the pyramids will boost the country's tourism industry.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Egypt was a top tourist destination but tourist numbers fell after the 2011 uprising.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Ancient sites in Egypt are on the bucket lists of many people around the world.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
At the Bent Pyramid, tourists will be able to go through a 79-meter narrow tunnel to reach two chambers deep inside.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They will also be able to see ancient treasures found inside the pyramid.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Egyptian archaeologists uncovered a collection of stone, clay and wooden sarcophagi - the coffins people were buried in.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Some of the sarcophagi contained mummies.
